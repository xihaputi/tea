# ML notes

- `notebooks/`: experiments and EDA.
- `data/`: local datasets for development (gitignore in real project).
- `train_disease_model.py`: placeholder training entrypoint.

Goal: start with transfer learning (e.g., EfficientNet-lite) for leaf disease classification, export a lightweight model for FastAPI inference.
